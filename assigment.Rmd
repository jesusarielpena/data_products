## Map using leaflet

```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(leaflet)

cities<- data.frame(
  lat = c(25.6866142,19.4326077,20.6596988,20.5887932,19.0412967,17.0594169,28.6329957,21.161908),
  lng = c(-100.3161126,-99.133208,-103.3496092,-100.3898881,-98.2061996,-96.7216219,-106.0691004,-86.8515279))
  visited<- c("monterrey","mexico","guadalajara","queretaro","puebla","oacaca","chihuahua","cancun")
